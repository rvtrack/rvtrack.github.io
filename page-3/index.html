	<span style="color:#333333;">Hello. My name is Keith Barr. I bring the best in establishing routines for losing weight, getting toned, preparing for competition and improving your quality of life. My experience and expertise breads success and confidence. I bring flexibility and strength to the table. You will get immediate and continued results. My clients have lost weight, gained muscle and strength, passed PT tests for the Army, excelled in sports in particular track and 5Ks, as well as rehabilitating clients with bad backs. It is important to me to be punctual. My passion is to see my clients succeed. I am cognizant that people have lives too and that I will work with you to figure out a training plan for you. I am compassionate and understand people have certain abilities. I have a certification in personal training from WITS. My background includes 20 years in physical therapy offices as well as athletics. I have been teaching kids up to 18 years of age the fine art of track. Having a background in therapy and athletics gives me a good blend of experience which would give my client the best chance at being successful at their goals. I have certifications in CPR and First Aid. Also, my degree is a Bachelor of Science in Biomedical Engineering which entails function of the human body systems including musculoskeletal system. What you get with me is a person who will do the work of planning your workouts, establishing goals at each session, making adjustments as you progress and letting you know when to push and when to back off. You will not have to think about what you need to do next or struggle with trying to figure out what would work best. I would do all of that for you! My background in healthcare would help you with decisions about your own healthcare. Nutrition would not be left out. Please contact me to get the best training that you are ever going to get! You can look me up on </span><span style="color:#333333;"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/keith-barr-153672109/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a></span><span style="color:#333333;">.<br /><br /></span><span style="color:#333333;font-weight:bold; "><u>REVIEWS<br /><br /></u></span><span style="color:#333333;"><em>Monica M.&nbsp;</em></span><span style="color:#333333;"><br /></span><span style="color:#333333;"><em>Personal Training</em></span><span style="color:#333333;">&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Keith was great!

He went above and beyond to help me achieve my goals. He is friendly and honest. Definitely recommend him!!&nbsp;<br />Keith Barr's reply&nbsp;<br />Thanks for your support! I appreciate the endorsement!&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I will start out with KEITH IS AN EXCEPTIONAL TRAINER! PLEASE DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND READ WHAT I WROTE BELOW!? You will save yourself a ton of aggravation trying different trainers!? (and just to clarify, I never met Keith before and had no idea the prodigious results I would get training with him)......SO, HERE WE GO........ I have been working out with weights and/or training martial arts almost my entire life (I am almost 50 years old). I BROKE MY BACK about 11 years ago (martial arts injury) and have undergone a number of surgeries (including spinal fusions). I have tried EVERYTHING possible to get back to normal or even semi-normal, such as medications, surgeries, injections, physical therapy (numerous times), acupuncture, chiropractors, massage, exercise, yoga, AND PERSONAL TRAINERS etc......with little or no positive results!! :( I have been training with Keith for about 8-9 months now and the results have been AMAZING!! When I started training with Keith, I couldn't walk for more than 3-5 minutes without having to sit down due to the pain in my lower back (it WAS debilitating)....NOW, I can walk for 30 MINUTES or more WITHOUT HAVING TO SIT OR USE A CANE to walk!! Keith is a brilliant professional, who cares about how I feel, is open-minded and uncommonly&nbsp;<br />knowledgeable! He is flexible and really listens to my feedback..........His methods have given me HOPE again! Due to him, I have made OUTSTANDING strides and see that my future probably does NOT include a wheelchair any longer :). I don't want to use the word MIRACLE, but it is pretty darn close!!! I can't say enough about his knowledge of the interaction of every muscle, tendon, nerve, bone etc.....and I know as a matter of fact that if I had worked with another trainer (because I have in the past), I would not have gotten such remarkable results in such a short time! I most likely would have gotten the same results I got on my own, because I am very knowledgeable about the human body myself due to all my experience in the gym/martial arts (I have trained a number of people in my past, just not professionally). I am so fortunate I hired him! Actually, thank goodness I hired him! He has literally made a HUGE difference in my life/lifestyle and I plan on training with him for a very long time to come! I honestly would pay double what he charges (shhhh....dont tell him that... haha) had I known the results I would get! If you want to get in shape, lose weight, body-build, power lift, just want to learn new techniques, or especially if you have any sports related injuries, I CANNOT RECOMMEND HIM ENOUGH!!!!! :) He has literally changed my life! If you aren't convinced, hire him for a couple session and I am confident you will be pleased with your training results!&nbsp;<br />Keith Barr's reply&nbsp;<br />Thank You very much for the review! Your accomplishments are why I do what I do.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></span><span style="color:#333333;"><em>Cherie S.&nbsp;<br />Personal Training</em></span><span style="color:#333333;">&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />I really enjoy working with Keith. I noticed instant results&nbsp;<br />Keith Barr's reply&nbsp;<br />Thank you so very much!&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></span><span style="color:#333333;"><em>Natalia B.&nbsp;<br />Personal Training&nbsp;<br /></em></span><span style="color:#333333;">&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />He is AWESOME!!! He really helped me gain muscle and tone up in all the right areas. Very nice and pushes you to accomplish and maintain your goals!!!<br /></span><span style="font:12px Times, Georgia, Courier, serif; "><br /><br /></span><strong><u>Pricing</u></strong>
